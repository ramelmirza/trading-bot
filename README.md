This project is a work in progress. It currently sends **GET requests** to **CoinMarketCap's API** and stores the JSON data inside a csv file.
  - **Data:**
    -   Price
    -   24H Volume
    -   24H % Change
    -   Market Cap
    -   Market Cap Dominance
    -   Date of Last Update
As I gain more comfortability with various libraries like pandas, numpy, etc (as well as my data science course in semester 5) I'll be sure to go beyond data scraping/cleaning and finally manipulate the data.
