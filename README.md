This project is a work in progress. It currently sends **GET requests** to **CoinMarketCap's API** and stores the JSON data inside a csv file.

**Data:**
  - Price
  - 24H Volume
  - 24H % Change
  - Market Cap
  - Market Cap Dominance
  - Date of Last Update

As I gain more comfortability with various libraries like pandas, numpy, etc (as well as my data science course in semester 5) - I'll manipulate the data (as now its just scraping/cleaning)
